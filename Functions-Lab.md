## JavaScript Functions Lab

### Prerequisites

- JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up

- You will need to make a new repository.
- Create new file called `Prompts.JS`
- Copy and paste prompts from lab into new file.
- Make sure to number the prompts you are answering in order to identify what is being answered.
- Complete the prompts below.

**Make a commit after each prompt you complete.**

### The Task

Below will be prompts you need to complete. You are to write the prompts as with function declaration and function expressions, this is to reinforce that you can do both.

#### Function Prompts

**Prompt 1:** Write a function, using function keyword, named `greeting`. When invoked, `greeting` should print the string 'hey there'.

**Prompt 2:** Write a function that can reverse a number.

**Prompt 3:** Write a function that checks whether the passed string is palindrome or not?

> A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward ex: madam

**Prompt 4:** Create a function named `alphaOrder` that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order.

**Example:**

```js
function alphaOrder( 'webmaster')
//Output : 'abeemrstw'
```

**Prompt 5:** Create a function named `changeToLowerCase` that accepts a string as a parameter and converts letters of each word of the string to lowercase.

**Example:**

```js
function changeToLowerCase('SaLly SeLls SeA ShelLs')
//output: 'sally sells sea shells'
```

**Prompt 6:** Make a function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in uppercase.

**Example:**

```js
function changeToUpperCase('sally sells sea shells')
//output: 'Sally Sells Sea Shells'
```

**Prompt 7:** Make a function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string.

```js
"Welcome to the developmental shop provided by Code Differently".

Longest Word: "developmental"
```

**Prompt 8:** Create a function that takes two parameters: a and b. When called, multiply a times b. Print the answer to the console.

**Prompt 9:** Make an array of your choosing and write a function that returns the array.

**Prompt 10:** Write a function to find the repeated character in a string.

## Its "Funktion" Time

**Choose 1 of the two below.**

**Create a Fortune Teller:**

- Write a function named `tellFortune` that:
  - takes 4 arguments: company, salary, geographic location, job title.
  - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a working for `company` making `salary`, living in `location` as a `job title`."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

**Create a Puppy Age Teller:**

- Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
  - takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
  - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
  - outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is **\_** years old in dog years!"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
